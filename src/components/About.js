                    My name is Joaquin Correa. I am a full stack software engineer, specialized on front-end 
                development with a certificate from the Flatiron School. Some of the technologies I work with are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Git</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>React.js</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                    <li>Ruby / Ruby on Rails</li>
                </ul>
                Currently I reside on the Greater New York metro area. In my recent years I discovered we are in a reality where we always need each other's help whether directly or indirectly. This is why I have an interest in 
                applying what I learn and constantly gain more knowledge to help others to the best of my extensions. I like to see myself as a team player. 
                Besides learning about my career, I have an interest in volunteering for social causes and local events, playing the ukulele, learning foreign languages, and enjoying metal and hard rock concerts. Feel free to reach out!
