                    Hey! My name is Joaquin Correa and I am a full stack software engineer, specialized on front-end 
                development. Recently, I graduated from the Flatiron School and now I am actively looking to make an entry into the IT world. 
                Currently I reside on the Greater New York area, but I am always open out of state offer. In my recent years I discovered we are in a world where we always need each other whether directly or indirectly. This is why I have interests in 
                applying what I learn and constantly gain more knowledge to help others to the best of my extensions. I like to see myself as a teamplayer. Besides learning about my career, I have an interest in playing the ukulele, learning foreign languages, and enjoy metal and hard rock concerts. Feel free to reach out!
                </p>
